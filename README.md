# Binary-search-and-randomized-binary-search-trees
This project is about a  management in a book warehouse network using binary search trees and randomized binary search trees.

- class BookInfo contains all the information concerning the books.
- class ST is the randomized binary search tree which has as nodes, TreeNode objects. Each ST instance is a warehouse. 

We have used merge sort so the user will be able to search for the book he wants faster.

-  Via SystemMenu.java the user is able to search the book he wants.

We have imported 3 warehouses in 3 different cities ("Thesalloniki", "Irakleio", "Ithaki") to check code's efficiency.
